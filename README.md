# IRBeaconRobotSensors
C code that is for the Arduino made for a competition and project in a college course. It navigates through a closed off course by itself and detects light from a beacon tower. There are obstacles in the way that must be avoided using ultrasonic ping sensors. Finally, the robot has to capture the beacon tower by receiving and transmitting an IR Signal from the tower.
